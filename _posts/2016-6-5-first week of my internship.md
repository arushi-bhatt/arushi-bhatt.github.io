title: # ** My Summer Internship 2016 at Fourtek IT Solutions Ltd. ! **
--- 
In Summer vacations 2016(june and July), I was appointed as an intern for non-tech and designing work at [_Fourtek It Solutions Ltd._](www.fourtek.com){:target="_blank"}, an IT firm in Noida,India.
That was really an awesome experience to share with you. I got exposure to a lot of things that was much necessary at that stage of my life as a beginnner to corporate tech world.
Following points are worthy of sharing :

 ~> **_Designing Work_** : As, mentioned in my previous blog, I was involved with then ongoing Project 'MISC'(M: Mentors , I: Investors, S: Startups, C: Cofounders). It aimed at building an online ecosystem connecting these main pillars of startup world.

 ~> **_SketchNotes_** : I started learning them just as memory mapping tool, but later I connected it with the Project MISC. The banners I produced are kind of sketchnotes only trying to portray the bottom idea.

 ~>**_LISP Programming_** : Apart from the non-tech work, I also focussed on my programming skills. Functional Programming, somehow drew my attention, and I started learning Racket (a dialect of Lisp) using Dr.Racket IDE.


 *Refer to this => [4 Major Programming Paradigms](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/prog3-03/html/notes/paradigms_themes-paradigm-overview-section.html){:target="_blank"} *


 As I believe in contextual learning, So, I decided to work on [ Project CodeCat ](https://github.com/arushi-bhatt/CodeCat){:target="_blank"}. It basically provides practice sessions for enhancing 'speed mathematical skills'.


 In the making of this project, I acquired the understanding of recursive functions, and substantial amount of knowledge of Scheme Programming.

Woah!! 
Finally, I started doing something amazing and more productive in my summer vacations.
And, Yes! I  also found great mentors  :) ..!!
What I was actually expecting with this new journey was, to try my hands in different fields  and technology realted to IT.
So, the first task given to me was to design banners for our new project : 'MISC WEBSITE'. It is basically related to startups world and aims at building a well sustaining ecosytem for the main players like cofounders,investors,mentors,and ofcourse the startup idea.
As a beginner,I started my task, by reading more about sketchnotes, designing freewares like GIMP, INKSCAPE , and KRITA. Though, I learnt at  substantially great level in inkscape, but I preffered GIMP. Gimp works best for bitmap images.
After a one week's work, I produced the desired result, which you can easily check out on this link :
