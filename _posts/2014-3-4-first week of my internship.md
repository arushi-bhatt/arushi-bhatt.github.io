---
Woah!! 
Finally, I started doing something amazing and more productive in my summer vacations.
And, Yes! I  also found great mentors  :) ..!!
What I was actually expecting with this new journey was to try my hands in different fields  and technology realted to IT.
So, the first task given to me was to design banners for our coming new launch of the 'MISC WEBSITE'. It is basically related to startups world and aims at building a well sustaining ecosytem for business world.
As a beginner,I started my task, by reading more about sketchnotes, designing freewares like GIMP, INKSCAPE , and KRITA. Though, I laerned at  substantially great level in inkscape, but I preffered GIMP. Gimp works best for bitmap images.
After a one week's work, I produced the desired result, which you can easily check out on this link :
