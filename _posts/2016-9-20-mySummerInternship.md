title: My Summer Internship 2016 at Fourtek IT Solutions Ltd. !
--- 
In Summer vacations 2016 (June and July), I was appointed as an intern for non-tech and designing work at [_Fourtek It Solutions Ltd._](www.fourtek.com){:target="_blank"}, an IT firm in Noida,India.
That was really an awesome experience to share with you. I got exposure to a lot of things that was much necessary at that stage of my life as a beginnner to corporate tech world.

Following points are worthy of sharing :

* ~> **_Designing Work_** : As, mentioned in my previous blog, I was involved with then ongoing Project 'MISC'(M: Mentors , I: Investors, S: Startups, C: Cofounders). It aimed at building an online ecosystem connecting these main pillars of startup world.

* ~> **_SketchNotes_** : I started learning them just as memory mapping tool, but later I connected it with the Project MISC. The banners I produced are kind of sketchnotes only trying to portray the bottom idea.

* ~>**_LISP Programming_** : Apart from the non-tech work, I also focussed on my programming skills. Functional Programming, somehow drew my attention, and I started learning Racket (a dialect of Lisp) using Dr.Racket IDE.

 *Refer to this => [4 Major Programming Paradigms](http://people.cs.aau.dk/~normark/prog3-03/html/notes/paradigms_themes-paradigm-overview-section.html){:target="_blank"} *

 As I believe in contextual learning, So, I decided to work on : 
1. [ Project CodeCat ](https://github.com/arushi-bhatt/CodeCat){:target="_blank"}. It basically provides practice sessions for enhancing 'speed mathematical skills'.
 In the making of this project, I acquired the understanding of recursive functions, and substantial amount of knowledge of Scheme Programming.
2. [Project Faker](https://github.com/arushi-bhatt/faker_file_internet_time){:target="_blank"}. It basically generates random file names and email ids. This feature can be used in gaming for producing fake data about the player. Here I used the object oriented features of Racket.

* ~> **_Project Management Tools_** like FreedCamp, for tracking important conversations regarding the projects.

* ~> **_Blog_** : started my blog site using jekyll

* ~> Other works like : Wireframes making, using Visual logic (D3) for effective representation of information, designing emailers for company's promotions.
