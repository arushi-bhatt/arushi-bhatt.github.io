title: # ** My Summer Internship 2016 at Fourtek IT Solutions Ltd. ! **
--- 
In Summer vacations 2016(june and July), I was appointed as an intern for non-tech and designing work at [_Fourtek It Solutions Ltd._](www.fourtek.com){:target="_blank"}, an IT firm in Noida,India.
That was really an awesome experience to share with you. I got exposure to a lot of things that was much necessary at that stage of my life as a beginnner to corporate tech world.
Following points are worthy of sharing :
 ~> **_Designing Work_** : As, mentioned in my previous blog, I was involved with then ongoing Project 'MISC'(M: Mentors , I: Investors, S: Startups, C: Cofounders). It aimed at building an online ecosystem connecting these main pillars of startup world.
 ~> **_SketchNotes_** : I started learning them just as memory mapping tool, but later I connected it with the Project MISC. The banners I produced are kind of sketchnotes only trying to portray the bottom idea.

 ~>**_LISP Programming_** : Apart from the non-tech work, I also focussed on my programming skills. Functional Programming, somehow drew my attention, and I started learning Racket (a dialect of Lisp) using Dr.Racket IDE.

 As I believe in contextual learning, So, I decided to work on [ Project CodeCat ](https://github.com/arushi-bhatt/CodeCat){:target="_blank"}. It basically provides practice sessions for enhancing 'speed mathematical skills'.
 In the making of this project, I acquired the understanding of recursive functions, and substantial amount of knowledge of Scheme Programming.
